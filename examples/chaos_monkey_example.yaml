# Simple example of the use of chaos monkey measurement.
#
# Notes on parameters:
#    failureRate is a percentage of all nodes that could fail simultinously.
#    interval is the time between node failures.
#    jitterFactor is a factor used to jitter node failures within [Interval, Interval + (1.0 + JitterFactor)] range.
#    simulatedDowntime is a duration between node is killed and recreated.
